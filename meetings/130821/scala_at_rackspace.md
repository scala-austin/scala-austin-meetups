a little about me

Freenode (IRC): tnks

- ex-Java developer of 5+ years
- studying functional programming for many of those years
- functional programming professionally for around 2 years
- programming Scala professionally for 6 months


a disclaimer
------------

The views of this presentation are mine, and not Rackspace's.

Even my team members may have slightly different interpretations, so please
feel free to talk to them too.

Here's a few that have been working in the Scala code base:

- Brad Brown
- Curtis Carter
- Franco Lazzarino



a little about Scala at Rackspace
---------------------------------

- Scala is relatively new to Rackspace
- we automate/integrate legacy systems in our DCs
- our domain + legacy application â‡’ complexity


why attracted to Scala, at first
--------------------------------

- fresh reboot with new code
- benefits of JVM as a platform (coming from Ruby/Rails)
- perhaps an improved talent pool
- plurality of programming paradigms
- actor system libraries
- improved correctness from type safety
- interest in FP


why stay with Scala
-------------------

- correctness
- benefits of JVM (though it's not perfect)
- modularity and extensibility with types
- typed highly-general abstractions
    - hard to do without types
    - reuse with less coupling
    - elegant, composeable APIs (DSLs)
- correctness


still seeing how these pan out
------------------------------

- improved talent pool
- need for actor system libraries


apprehensive of now
-------------------

- plurality of programming paradigms
    - loss of composition
    - loss in correctness
    - we subset our use of Scala
